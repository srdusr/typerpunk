/*
 * The following code defines a typing game in Rust.
 * 
 * In main, the game loop is started by calling `run_game()`.
 * 
 * The `GameState` struct represents the state of the game, including the difficulty level, 
 * the current paragraph to type, the player's progress, and various methods for manipulating 
 * and querying the game state. These methods include:
 * 
 * - `new(difficulty: Difficulty)`: creates a new game state with the given difficulty.
 * - `get_paragraph(difficulty: Difficulty)`: returns a random paragraph of the specified difficulty.
 * - `wpm(&self)`: calculates the current words per minute of the player.
 * - `accuracy(&self)`: calculates the current accuracy of the player.
 * - `check_end_condition(&self)`: checks if the game has ended.
 * - `advance(&mut self)`: advances the game to the next character.
 * - `reset(&mut self)`: resets the game state to its initial state.
 * 
 * The `Difficulty` enum represents the difficulty level of the game, and includes a method to create 
 * an enum variant from a string:
 * 
 * - `from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, &'static str>`: creates a difficulty enum variant from a string.
 * 
 * The `App` struct represents the application as a whole, and includes methods for handling input, 
 * updating the game state, setting the game difficulty, resetting the game, and setting the current 
 * application state. These methods include:
 * 
 * - `new()`: creates a new `App` instance.
 * - `handle_input(&mut self, input: Key)`: handles keyboard input.
 * - `update(&mut self, elapsed: Duration)`: updates the game state based on the elapsed time.
 * - `set_difficulty(&mut self, difficulty: Difficulty)`: sets the game difficulty.
 * - `reset_game(&mut self)`: resets the game state to its initial state.
 * - `set_state(&mut self, state: AppState)`: sets the current application state.
 * 
 * The `AppState` enum represents the state of the application, including whether the game is being played, 
 * whether the player is viewing their stats, or whether the game is quitting. The enum variants include:
 * 
 * - `Playing(GameState)`: represents the game state while the game is being played.
 * - `Stats(GameState, Instant)`: represents the game state and start time while displaying stats.
 * - `Quit`: represents the state where the game is quitting.
